# Financial Fraud Detection using LLM + RAG

A cutting-edge **Large Language Model (LLM)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered system designed to **detect, explain, and prevent financial fraud** in real-world datasets. This project demonstrates how **Generative AI + Knowledge Retrieval** can be applied to mission-critical domains like banking and finance.

---

## Project Overview
Financial fraud is a massive challenge across **banking, trading, insurance, and fintech**. Traditional ML models can detect anomalies, but they **lack explainability** and **struggle with evolving fraud patterns**.  

This project combines:
- **LLMs** (for reasoning, explanations, natural language interaction)  
- **RAG pipelines** (for grounding answers with trusted domain knowledge)  
- **Fraud detection datasets** (structured + unstructured)  

---

## Objectives
- Detect **fraudulent patterns** in financial transactions
- Provide **natural language explanations** for flagged anomalies
- Enable **interactive Q&A** (e.g., “Why was this transaction flagged?”)
- Reduce **false positives** using context-aware retrieval
- Demonstrate **scalable LLM + RAG pipeline** for finance

---

## Methodology (Pipeline)

### 1. Data Preparation
- Pre-processed financial transaction dataset (legit vs fraud)
- Generated embeddings for structured + textual metadata
- Stored in a **vector database** for retrieval

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Retriever**: fetches top-k most relevant transaction records / rules  
- **Generator (LLM)**: contextualizes retrieved data → outputs decision + reasoning  

### 3. Fraud Detection
- Traditional anomaly detection (baseline: Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
- Enhanced with **LLM-based classification** + **explanations**

### 4. Explainability & Q&A
- Users can query in natural language:
  > "Why is Transaction ID 1245 flagged as suspicious?"  
  > "What patterns indicate money laundering in this dataset?"  

- RAG ensures answers are **grounded in real data + domain knowledge**.

---

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Approach**: ML + LLM for accuracy + interpretability  
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Domain-specific fraud rules + regulations via RAG  
- **Explainable AI**: Not just detection, but **why it’s fraud**  
- **Interactive Assistant**: Fraud Q&A chatbot for analysts & regulators  
- **Scalable**: Built with modular design (easily plug in OpenAI, LLaMA, Falcon etc.)

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**
- **LangChain** (RAG pipeline)
- **FAISS / ChromaDB** (vector database for retrieval)
- **OpenAI / LLaMA / HuggingFace LLMs**
- **Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy** (fraud ML baselines)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (EDA & visualization)

---

## Results & Outcomes
- Detected fraud with higher recall than baseline ML models  
- LLM explanations increased **trust & interpretability** for analysts  
- Reduced false alarms via **RAG-grounded reasoning**  
- Built prototype for **fraud Q&A assistant** → easily extendable to AML, KYC
